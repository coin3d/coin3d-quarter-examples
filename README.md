Coin3D examples using the Quarter GUI

The mle-quarter-examples project provides examples for Open Inventor programming using the Coin 3D SDK and Quarter toolkit.
These examples were tested against older versions of Coin and Quarter and may not be relavent to the current state of the
Coin 3D libraries.

A more comprehensive collection of examples may be found at [ivexamples](https://github.com/coin3d/ivexamples), which
are kept up to date with the latest Coin and Quarter technology.
